This data was symmetrically distributed without outliers and a clear value of central tendency. In this case, the all the measures of dispersion (standard deviation, MAD and IQR) should be on the same scale. However, as they measure different things it is unreasonable to expect they are all the same. Let's go ahead and calculate all of these.
